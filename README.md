# How to run

> Getting Started with Ionic: http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/ (For reference)

1. Install Node.js v4: https://nodejs.org/en/ (Node.js v5 does not work at the moment!).
2. Install the latest Cordova and Ionic command-line tools (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic) by running this on the command line: `npm install -g cordova ionic`
3. Follow the Android (http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/android/index.html) or iOS (http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/ios/index.html) platform guides to install required platform dependencies.
4. Navigate to the root of the project, and use the Ionic tool to build and run the app, using the commands below:

  `ionic build android`

  `ionic emulate android` (or `ionic serve` to start a local development server to test and run your app in a browser)

  (To build the app for iOS, run `ionic platform add ios` and substitute "android" with "ios" in the commands above)
